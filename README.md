# A template for UniGraz-DH poster

This template is based on the `baposter` class written by Brian Amberg and now maintained by Pieter van Oostrum:

## Philosophy

The `baposter` class is a self-contained LaTeX class for presentation slides:
+ It is largely self-contained, with no need for sophisticated packages or theme stylesheets (see `beamer`)
+ The layout relies on a grid---it can be made visible in the design phase---, on which `box` elements can be placed. The layout scheme is flat, with no hierarchical relationship between blocks. Positioning use either row/col coordinates or relative locations between boxes.
+ The template is easy to customize.


## How to use

Linux shell:

```
# with the baposter.cls file in the same directory
$ pdflatex poster
```

Overleaf:

1. Download this repo as a ZIP file
